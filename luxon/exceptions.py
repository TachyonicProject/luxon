    The 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) status code indicates that none of

    the current extent of the selected resource or that the set of ranges
    requested has been rejected due to invalid ranges or an excessive
    request of small or overlapping ranges.

    For byte ranges, failing to overlap the current extent means that the
    first-byte-pos of all of the byte-range-spec values were greater than
    the current length of the selected representation.  When this status
    code is generated in response to a byte-range request, the sender
    SHOULD generate a Content-Range header field specifying the current
    length of the selected representation (Section 4.2).

    For example:
        HTTP/1.1 416 Range Not Satisfiable
        Date: Fri, 20 Jan 2012 15:41:54 GMT
        Content-Range: bytes \*/47022

    Note: Because servers are free to ignore Range, many
    implementations will simply respond with the entire selected
    representation in a 200 (OK) response.  That is partly because
    most clients are prepared to receive a 200 (OK) to complete the
    task (albeit less efficiently) and partly because clients might
    not stop making an invalid partial request until they have
    received a complete representation.  Thus, clients cannot depend
